Version 1.6
-----------------
- Use sendmail instead of mail also when sending a general error mail

Version 1.5
-----------------
- Use sendmail instead of mail
- Improved SLES9 compatibility
- set LC_NUMERIC to prevent incompatibilities due to localization
- some minor stuff (can't remember the details)

Version 1.4
-----------------
- Fixed a bug that caused the incremental backup to fail if the date changed
  during the backup (e.g. if you run RBME at 11pm)
- Fixed a bug that there was no lockfile to prevent parallel execution of the
  same RBME instance
- Send an email on fatal errors
- Emails have a better subject now (RBME: <instance> ...)

Version 1.3
-----------------
- Fixed a bug that I unfortunately introduced with 1.2
  The bug would prevent correct rbme operation when deleting old backups

Version 1.2
-----------------
- logging and output improvements for cron jobs
  * no output to stdout
  * send concise email report
  * write full log to rotating logfile
- instance support. Run multiple rbme with independant configuration
  * shared master configuration /etc/rbme.conf
  * instance configuration /etc/<instance>.conf
  * create new instance by symlinking to rbme executable
